			<h2>ABOUT</h2>
			<hr>

			<p>
				I've tried to learn many coding languages, but the ones that I've stuck with the most are Python and HTML+CSS.<br>I know the basics of how JavaScript works, but I don't use it that often.
				<br><br>
				I use Python for any project that doesn't need a website — not a lot of my projects and ideas have been published or released online (publicly), because most of them are simply short experiments or personal scripts that I'm not sure would be of much use to others. Someday I may go through all of these old experiments and projects and clean them up for public use, but as for now I don't plan to anytime soon.
				<br><br>
				My largest project so far has been Lilac ("Lilacbot", "Lilac-bot") — a <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> bot made with Python 3.5 using <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py">discord.py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/thisbejim/Pyrebase">Pyrebase</a> for the Dogspotter Scoreboard server that keeps track of each user's score. The <a href="https://alpha-hedge.github.io/dogspotter-scoreboard/">Dogspotter Scoreboard</a> is simply a way to view the user scores in a nicer-looking table. Even though the website came before the bot (which was created as an easier way to track score than manually editing the site's HTML), the server itself and Lilac are moreso the main focus now.
