			<h2>ABOUT</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				I do programming & coding as mostly a hobby, and music as a more professional thing. More info about each topic can be found on their respective pages, but to summarize;
				<br><br>
				For coding: I've been doing coding since around 2016; I've tried to learn many coding languages, but the ones that I've stuck with the most are Python and HTML+CSS.<br>I know the basics of how JavaScript works, but I don't use it that often.
				<br><br>
				For music: I've been making music since around 2015; The music I make normally consists of a combination of synths and orchestral/acoustic instruments like pianos, guitars, and strings.
				<br><br>
				This website was made primarily as a way to redirect to either my other projects and music. I may use it to server as a personal blog in the future, as well.
